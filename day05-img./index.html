    <b><i>If image is in same folder in which you are working then just use. <img src="graduation.png"></i></b>
    <p>Mark it important if you use 'alt tag' by giving it a meassage that if browser is not able to search and show
        image
        then browser need to show a Error message like this Error: Immage not found! This will be possble only if you
        write
        your code in this way <img src="logo.png" alt="Error: Image not found"></p>.

    <p>And if you want your image to be of proper width and height or width only then make sure you write code like this
        <img src="graduation.png" alt="Image error" width="100" height="100">
    </p>

    <h4><b>If your image is in same folder in which you are working use <img src=".png" alt="error" width="50"> </b>
    </h4>
    <h4><b>If your image is in another folder then <img src="/assets/.png" alt="error" width="50"> </b></h4>
    <h4><b>If your image is like this (folder1 > folder y > image) then <img src="../folder/.png" alt="error"
                width="50"> </b></h4>
</body>
