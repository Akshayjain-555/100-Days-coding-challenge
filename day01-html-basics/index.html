    <h1>Hello Universe! I'm starting my 100 days challenge!</h1>`

<p>Today I'm learning HTML — only the part needed to build my Note Taking App.</p>

<p>Today is Day 1 of my 100 Days Challenge.</p>

<p>What is HTML? And why is it necessary to build a Website or Application?</p>

<p>Basically, HTML is the base of your Website or Web App. It’s the skeleton of your full programming journey.</p>
<p>I'm on the mission to build a Note Taking App manually by learning coding from scratch.</p>
